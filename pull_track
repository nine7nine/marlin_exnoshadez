commit 94f389401c8ce318a34cbb36e2e7941b32da051b

 rfcomm, sched/wait: Fix broken wait construct

rfcomm_run() is a tad broken in that is has a nested wait loop. One
cannot rely on p->state for the outer wait because the inner wait will
overwrite it.

=>	Similar code could exist in Qualcomm's driver code and should probably 
	be looked at, at some point.

3.19 Locking

=> 	much of the locking code already exists in Marlin, just grabbed the 
	remainging bits

3.19 / 4.0 TODO: 

=>	Get the akpm / mm code merged in - more of a challenge. 
	big changes and conflicts. might have to be very selective.

Commit 39a23beb2dff0df266602786c8dfeffe72103484

removes the queue work on system_power_efficient_wq ...

	#1. we don't need it.
	#2. it seems to interfere with accuracy in batterystats
	#3. The polling interval he refers to has been cut in half, 
	    so these patches are arguably redundant.

commit 42a16646c1669295e2c4fec5dc15228a8a28f4e8

=> 	enabling CONFIG_SCHED_WALT_DEFAULT=y sets the below sysctl values,
	These can be removed from init.exnoshadez.rc 
	

#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_WALT_DEFAULT
unsigned int sysctl_sched_use_walt_cpu_util = 1;
unsigned int sysctl_sched_use_walt_task_util = 1;

commit 08c53a651c24ec6350d5ef55c21bee81cd4ca055 (NOT APPLIED!)

UPSTREAM: sched: use load_avg for selecting idlest group

=>	Found in aosp/kernel_common/android-4.9-eas-dev, causes the camera to 
	crash, this commit may be responsible for crashing with the binder/dev 
	branch - still to be verified. Do NOT apply
